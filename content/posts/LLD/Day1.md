In software engineering, writing clean, maintainable, and scalable code starts with mastering the **SOLID Principles**. These five key guidelines are essential for every developer, especially at the SDE-2/Senior Engineer level.

---

## ✅ S — Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)  
> *A class should have only one reason to change.*  

- Each class or module should handle one responsibility.  
- **Example:** In a banking app, `TransactionService` handles transactions, `NotificationService` handles notifications — never both in one class.

---

## ✅ O — Open/Closed Principle (OCP)  
> *Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.*  

- You should be able to add new functionality without altering existing code.  
- **Example:** Use interfaces and inheritance or composition to extend behavior without changing existing classes.

---

## ✅ L — Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)  
> *Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes.*  

- A subclass should not break the behavior expected by the parent class.  
- **Example:** If `Bird` can fly, `Penguin` should not extend `Bird` if it can’t fly — this violates LSP.

---

## ✅ I — Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)  
> *No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.*  

- Split large interfaces into smaller, specific ones.  
- **Example:** `Printable` and `Scannable` instead of a fat `Machine` interface with unrelated methods.

---

## ✅ D — Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)  
> *Depend on abstractions, not on concrete implementations.*  

- High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules — both should depend on abstractions.  
- **Example:** Use interfaces or abstract classes for dependencies and inject them (e.g., via constructors).

## 📝 Why SOLID Matters in Low-Level Design?  
- Reduces tight coupling  
- Increases code reusability  
- Makes your system more flexible to change  
- Leads to cleaner architecture — crucial for microservices or large backend systems

## 📌 My Takeaway  
> Mastering SOLID isn’t just theory — it shapes how you think about every class, service, and feature you build.
